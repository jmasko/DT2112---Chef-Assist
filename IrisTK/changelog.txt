- Bug fixes
- Addon Dragon has changed name to NuanceCloud, the file containing the API key is now called license.properties
- A new model for controlling which models are being used for speech recognition has been introduced, called "Context". Grammars (speech and semantics) are now loaded with loadContext(). Also, to listen with a specific grammar, use the attribute "context" and not "grammar". See the tutorials for examples on how to do this.
